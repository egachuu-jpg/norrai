## Target Verticals

Norr AI serves any local or regional business with repetitive client communications, scheduling, or data workflows. The full target market includes:

🏡 Real estate agents · 🦷 Dental offices · 👁️ Eye clinics · ✂️ Hair salons & barbershops · ⛳ Golf courses · 🌿 Greenhouses & nurseries · 🔧 Plumbers & electricians · 🏗️ Construction companies · 🛡️ Insurance brokers · 💆 Spas & wellness studios · 🐾 Veterinary clinics · 🚗 Auto repair shops · 🏋️ Gyms & fitness studios · 🌄 Landscaping companies

### Verticals with Detailed Playbooks Built Out

**Dental** — Starter pitch: no-show math. Workflows: appointment reminders, missed appointment follow-up, review requests, missed call → SMS, new patient intake. Growth anchor: dormant patient reactivation. Pro: Dentrix/Eaglesoft pipeline → production dashboard.

**Real Estate** — Starter pitch: speed-to-lead. Workflows: instant lead response (Claude personalizes by listing), 7-touch cold nurture, missed call → SMS, listing description generator, open house follow-up. Growth anchor: sphere of influence re-engagement. Pro: MLS feed, deal velocity dashboard, lead scoring.

**Insurance** — Starter pitch: renewal math. Workflows: renewal reminders (90/60/30/7 days), post-renewal thank you + review request, lapsed win-back, quote request response, missed call → SMS. Growth anchor: cross-sell campaign. Pro: book-of-business pipeline, retention risk scoring.

---

## Architecture Decisions

- Own the infrastructure from day one: Twilio numbers, Postgres, n8n instance. Client pays for the service — Norr AI owns the stack.
- All Tier 1 n8n workflows write events to Postgres so Tier 2 inherits clean history.
- Transition framing when upgrading a client: "we expanded the system" not "we rebuilt everything."
- Run Tier 1 and Tier 2 in parallel for 2–4 weeks during upgrade — zero downtime.

**Lead Cleansing Architecture:** A staging layer sits between all intake sources and downstream nurture workflows. Every intake source normalizes to a single payload shape before hitting the cleansing workflow.

Normalized payload shape:
```json
{
  "lead_name": "Sarah Johnson",
  "email": "sarah@gmail.com",
  "phone": "5075551234",
  "source": "zillow",
  "property_address": "123 Maple St",
  "price_range": "$250k-$320k",
  "beds": 3,
  "lead_message": "..."
}
```

Dedupe check: CRM lookup by email + phone before firing any sequence. Existing lead → update record, stop. New lead → fire downstream.

## n8n Operational Notes

- Always use `/webhook/` production path, NOT `/webhook-test/`, for live clients.
- Timezone: n8n Cloud runs UTC. Use `America/Chicago` with `hour12: false` for Central time.
- Business hours IF node: use two separate conditions (`>= 8` AND `< 17`), not a single JS expression.
- SendGrid click tracking: disable for transactional emails to avoid Promotions tab.
- Twilio subaccounts: one master account, one subaccount per client.
- Expression path: raw JSON from webhooks comes through as `$json.fieldname` (no `.body.` wrapper).
- Multiline Claude prompts: build in Set node first, pass as single `$json.prompt` variable to HTTP Request.

Timezone expression used in Missed Call workflow:
```js
parseInt(new Date().toLocaleString('en-US', {timeZone: 'America/Chicago', hour12: false}).split(', ')[1].split(':')[0])
```

## Workflows Built

### Missed Call → Auto SMS
- **Status:** Working end to end
- **Stack:** Twilio webhook → n8n IF node (business hours check) → Twilio SMS (two branches: in-hours / after-hours message)
- **Pending:** Upgrade Twilio account from trial, buy local 507 area code number to replace toll-free 855 number

### Listing Description Generator
- **Status:** Working end to end
- **Stack:** Webhook → Set node (build prompt) → HTTP Request (Claude API) → Code node (parse response) → SendGrid
- Claude returns plain text with `HEADLINE:` / `MLS_DESCRIPTION:` / `SOCIAL_MEDIA_POST:` labels — Code node splits on these
- Email sends from studio@norrai.co via SendGrid native n8n node
- Agent voice personalization: few-shot prompting with 3–5 of agent's previous listings pasted into prompt
- **Webhook URL:** `https://norrai.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/listing-description`

### Event Ops Discovery Form
- **Status:** Working end to end
- **Stack:** `event_ops_discovery.html` → n8n webhook → (review + routing)
- 6-section discovery questionnaire: About You, Event Volume & Types, Where Your Time Goes (1–5 rating scales), Current Tools & Stack, Repetitive Work, Priorities & Goals
- Collects: team size, capacity gap, events/year, attendee volume, event types, time-sink ratings across 7 categories, current registration/comms/data tools, manual step walkthrough, recurring email and report types, biggest pain, success criteria, openness to new tools
- Payload fields include multi-select pill groups serialized as comma-separated strings, rating scale values as integers, and free-text fields
- **Webhook URL placeholder:** `https://YOUR-N8N-INSTANCE.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/event-ops-discovery`
- **Origin:** Built for a warm lead — senior event ops manager at Prep Network who lost two employees; her director is also running an internal AI automation analysis this quarter

## Brand — Polar Modern

All HTML files should use this design system:

```css
--bone:      #FAFAF7;   /* background */
--ink:       #0A0F1A;   /* primary text, header bg */
--glacial:   #7FA9B8;   /* accent, focus states */
--graphite:  #3A3F48;   /* button hover */
--blush:     #E8D4C4;   /* warm accent */
--surface:   #FFFFFF;
--border:    #E5E4DE;
--muted:     #9EA3AA;
--secondary: #6A6F78;

font-display: 'Inter Tight'
font-body:    'Inter'
font-mono:    'JetBrains Mono'
```

---

## Testing

**Test stack:** Playwright (`npm test`)
**Test file:** `tests/listing_form.spec.js` — 41 tests covering `listing_form.html`

### Rules
- **Run `npm test` before pushing any code changes.** All tests must pass.
- **When adding new functionality to a tested file, add tests for it first (or alongside).** Do not ship new form fields, JS behavior, or payload changes without corresponding test coverage.
- **When editing a file that has no test file, create one.** Scope the tests to the risk level of the file (see below).
- New test coverage should follow the existing patterns in `tests/listing_form.spec.js`: use `fillRequired()` + `mockWebhook()` helpers, `Promise.all` for request interception, and wait for UI state (success banner, etc.) before asserting async side effects like localStorage.

### Risk-based test coverage

| Risk | File type | Minimum coverage |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| **High** | Forms that submit to a webhook (listing_form, event_ops_discovery) | Full: required fields, type enforcement, payload shape, localStorage, UI states, security header |
| **Medium** | Marketing/vertical pages with interactive elements or JS | Key interactions, navigation links resolve, no JS errors on load |
| **Low** | Static display pages with no JS (brand_concepts, style_guide) | Smoke test only: page loads, title correct, no console errors |

Forms that touch the n8n → Claude → SendGrid pipeline are **high risk** — bad data produces silent failures with real cost (API calls, emails sent). Test them thoroughly.

---

## Open Tasks

### Immediate
- [x] Connect `listing_form.html` to n8n production webhook URL
- [ ] Upgrade Twilio account, buy local 507 number, replace toll-free 855
- [x] Complete SendGrid domain authentication DNS records for norrai.co
- [ ] Open Relay business bank account once MN LLC approval certificate arrives

### Near Term
- [ ] Write Growth tier Claude prompts: SOI re-engagement (real estate), cross-sell campaign (insurance)
- [x] Design Postgres schema as connective tissue between Tier 1 and Tier 2
- [x] Build real estate Starter workflows: instant lead response, open house follow-up, 7-touch cold nurture
- [x] Build real estate Starter: review request — form + workflow + tests complete (2026-04-30)
- [x] Test and promote real estate workflows to production — open house setup + follow-up confirmed working
- [ ] Fix nurture_enroll.html: make email required (known gap — T1/T3/T5 are email-only, no guard)
- [ ] Set up Cloudflare Access (Zero Trust) on agent-facing forms before handing URL to first client
- [ ] Set up internal monitoring dashboard (red/green per client status) — needed at 10+ clients
- [x] Deploy HTML tools to tools.norrai.co (Cloudflare Pages)
- [x] Build B&B Manufacturing estimating demo — form + n8n workflow + tests (see 2026-04-29 session log)
- [x] Build B&B lead generator workflow — n8n schedule + Apollo.io + Claude scoring + SendGrid review email + Neon logging
- [ ] Smoke test B&B workflow: import JSON into n8n, fire test payload, verify estimate email
- [ ] Swap placeholder rates with real B&B rates once obtained
- [ ] Add Neon logging nodes to B&B workflow when B&B is onboarded as a client
- [ ] Move B&B rate card to Google Sheets for production (so B&B staff can update rates without touching n8n)

### First Client Targets
- Insurance broker friend — Salesforce user, discovery call framework ready
- Dental and real estate — easiest to template and repeat
- **B&B Manufacturing** (Faribault, MN) — warm prospect, demo estimating workflow built; lead generator workflow built; pending smoke tests and n8n import for both; Apollo.io account is a required dependency B&B must provision

---

## Sales Principles

- Lead with ROI in the client's language, never with technology. Dentists think in appointment values. Realtors think in GCI. Insurance brokers think in retained premium.
- Never lead with n8n, Claude, or "automation."
- Salesforce positioning for insurance: "we complete Salesforce, not compete with it."
- Key insurance qualifying question: "If I told you there were clients about to leave at renewal and you don't know who they are — what would it be worth to find out in advance?"

---

## Database

**Platform:** Neon — project `norrai` (ID: `gentle-hill-54285247`), Postgres 17, `us-east-1`
**Database:** `neondb` | **Branch:** `main`
**Connection string:** stored in `.env` as `DATABASE_URL` (pooled)

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `clients` | NorrAI client businesses — tier, vertical, status, contact info |
| `service_contracts` | Billing history per client |
| `twilio_subaccounts` | One Twilio subaccount + phone number per client |
| `norrai_meetings` | NorrAI's own discovery/onboarding/check-in calls |
| `leads` | End-customer leads across all verticals; vertical-specific fields in `metadata` jsonb |
| `appointments` | End-customer appointments; tracks reminder/follow-up/review-request timestamps |
| `workflow_events` | Audit log of every n8n workflow trigger/completion/failure |

**Vertical-specific lead fields** go in `leads.metadata` jsonb:
```json
// Real estate
{ "property_address": "123 Maple St", "price_range": "$250k-$320k", "beds": 3 }
// Insurance
{ "policy_type": "auto", "renewal_date": "2026-09-01", "current_carrier": "State Farm" }
// Dental
{ "procedure_type": "cleaning", "insurance": "Delta Dental", "last_visit": "2024-11-01" }
```

## Session Log

### 2026-04-23
- Added `norr_ai_favicon.svg` to all 12 HTML pages
- Connected `listing_form.html` to production webhook (`https://norrai.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/listing-description`)
- Added localStorage agent profile persistence — saves `agent_name`, `agent_email`, `previous_listings` across sessions; "· saved / clear" badge in Your Voice section
- Split single address field into `street_address`, `city`, `state` (default MN), `zip`, `county`; constructs `property_address` for workflow
- Added price currency pattern validation + blur auto-format; changed `lot_size` to `type="number"` with decimal enforcement
- Added `X-Norr-Token` shared secret header to form fetch + n8n IF node for basic auth
- Fixed n8n workflow: removed hardcoded example listings, wired `previous_listings` from payload, fixed field name mismatches, added all new fields to Claude prompt, fixed `JSON.stringify` on prompt to prevent bad control character error, fixed double `$$` on price
- n8n workflow now includes Token Check IF node + Valid Email Check against DataTable allowlist
- Set up Playwright test suite — 41 tests, all passing (`npm test`)
- Initialized git repo, pushed to `github.com/egachuu-jpg/norrai`
- Deployed to Cloudflare Pages, custom domain `tools.norrai.co` live

### 2026-04-24
- Set up Neon Postgres — project `norrai` (`gentle-hill-54285247`), Postgres 17, `us-east-1`
- Applied `db/schema.sql` to production database: 7 tables (`clients`, `service_contracts`, `twilio_subaccounts`, `norrai_meetings`, `leads`, `appointments`, `workflow_events`), `set_updated_at()` trigger, indexes
- Added `DATABASE_URL` to `.env`, added `.env` to `.gitignore`
- Loaded test data across all 7 tables — 5 clients (dental, real estate, insurance, auto, wellness), realistic leads with vertical metadata, appointments, workflow events

### 2026-04-26
- Built `website/lead_response.html` + `n8n/workflows/Real Estate Instant Lead Response.json` — agent pastes a new lead, Claude drafts personalized SMS + email reply within 60 seconds; agent gets a copy preview
- Built `website/open_house.html` + `n8n/workflows/Real Estate Open House Follow-Up.json` — QR code on door, attendees sign in on their phone, Claude writes personalized follow-up sent at 9am CT next morning via SMS + email (if provided)
- Built `website/nurture_enroll.html` + `n8n/workflows/Real Estate 7-Touch Cold Nurture.json` — agent enrolls a cold lead, 6 Claude-written touches over 21 days (Day 1 email, Day 3 SMS, Day 7 email, Day 10 SMS, Day 14 email, Day 21 SMS); includes disconnected Auto-Trigger webhook node for future automation
- All 3 workflows use token check (`X-Norr-Token`), same Anthropic + SendGrid credentials as listing description workflow
- Created `n8n/TESTING_NOTES.md` — known gotchas, gaps, and production promotion checklist
- Created `n8n/TESTING_GUIDE.md` — step-by-step testing instructions per workflow
- Discussed DB architecture: `appointments` table schema is fine to keep, but don't build calendar scraping/normalization layer until a real client forces it
- Discussed agent-facing form auth: Cloudflare Access (Zero Trust) is the right answer — free up to 50 users, email OTP, protects specific paths; defer until first real agent client

### 2026-04-30
- Fixed Open House Setup workflow: HTML email was arriving as a file attachment in Gmail due to unescaped `&` in QR/signin URLs inside HTML attributes
- Moved email HTML construction into the "Build QR URL" Code node with `&amp;`-escaped URLs
- Replaced SendGrid node with HTTP Request node calling SendGrid v3 API directly (`text/html` content type, `JSON.stringify` for body value)
- Requires "Header Auth" credential in n8n: Authorization: Bearer SG.xxx
- Open House Setup + Open House Follow-Up both tested and confirmed working end to end

### 2026-04-29
- Brainstormed and designed automated estimating workflow for **B&B Manufacturing and Assembly** (Faribault, MN) — 55,000 sq ft metal fab shop, 50+ employees, custom fabrication for OEMs across ag, aerospace, food processing, industrial markets
- Design: web form → n8n → Claude API (line-item estimate with rate card) → SendGrid email to submitter within ~60 seconds; no human in the loop for demo
- Built `website/bnb_estimate_form.html` — all 10 services (laser cutting, waterjet, CNC, press brake, welding, sandblasting, powder coating, plating, deburring, assembly), conditional detail fields per service, Polar Modern design
- Built `n8n/workflows/B&B Manufacturing Estimate.json` — 6 nodes: Webhook (responds immediately) → Token Check → Build Claude Prompt (Code) → Claude API → Parse + Build Email (Code) → SendGrid
- Rate card baked into Claude prompt as placeholder rates; designed for easy swap to Google Sheets in production
- Claude outputs structured JSON; Code node builds full HTML email with line-item table, totals, lead time, disclaimer
- Added 24 Playwright tests (`tests/bnb_estimate_form.spec.js`) — all passing; full suite 132/132
- Added B&B testing section to `n8n/TESTING_NOTES.md` — import checklist, test payload, known gaps
- Design spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-28-bnb-estimating-design.md`
- Implementation plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-28-bnb-estimating.md`
- **Pending:** smoke test (import workflow into n8n, fire test payload, verify email) — deferred to after work
- Brainstormed and designed automated lead generator for B&B Manufacturing — Monday 6am schedule, Apollo.io search (250-mile radius, OEM industries, decision-maker titles, verified emails), Google Sheet exclusion list with JobBOSS stub, Claude scoring (1-10, 8+ threshold), SendGrid review email to B&B inbox with drafted outreach copy, Neon logging per qualified lead
- Design spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-29-bnb-lead-generator-design.md`; Implementation plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-29-bnb-lead-generator.md`
